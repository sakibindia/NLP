# NLP Emotional classifier
Our training and validation dataset is comprised of more than 10000 from traindata with labelled emotions of five classes: neutral, happy, sad, anger, hate.
We have achieved a positive result by achieving more than 73% overall classification accuracy and precision.
In particular, we have achieved good validation accuracy on happy, sad, hate and anger (91% precision!) classes. Hate and anger were sometimes misclassified as sadness (occurs in Test data as well).
I have usev MNB classifier but it give only 43% accuracy, I tried sgd classifier i got more than 73% accurcy.
